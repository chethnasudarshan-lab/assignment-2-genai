CampusPe Python Programming – Assignment 2

Student Name: S CHETHANA

Project Overview

This assignment includes 20 Python programs created to practice and 
demonstrate key Python concepts. The programs cover topics such as user input/output, 
arithmetic calculations, string handling, conditional statements, loops, functions,
and number-based logic. Each program is designed to solve a specific problem in a clear
and structured way, helping to develop both programming skills and logical thinking.

List of Programs:

1.Personal Bio Display

2.Basic Calculator

3.String Manipulation Program

4.Age Calculation Program

5.Expense Sharing Calculator

6.Grade Evaluation System

7.Temperature Conversion Program

8.Leap Year Validation

9.Ticket Fare Calculation System

10.ATM Simulation Program

11.Number Pattern Generator

12.Multiplication Table Generator

13.Sum and Average Calculator

14.Factorial Computation Program

15.Prime Number Validation

16.Number Guessing Game

17.Palindrome Verification Program

18.Function-Based Calculator

19.Text Analysis Utilities

20.Number System Operations

How to Run

Each program can be executed individually using:
python script_name.py
Programs are interactive; follow the prompts in the console.
Python 3.x is required for all scripts.

Challenges Encountered

Handling User Input: Making sure programs handled incorrect or unexpected inputs without crashing, 
especially in interactive programs like the Number Guessing Game, ATM Simulation, and Expense Calculator.
Logical Problem-Solving: Programs such as the Number Pattern Generator, Prime Number Validation,
Factorial Calculator, and Number System Operations required careful thinking to implement loops and conditions correctly.
Function Design: Using functions to organize code and avoid repetition helped make the programs clearer and easier to manage.


Code Organization: 
Keeping 20 separate programs organized and readable was important to 
maintain structure and consistency across the assignment.

Learning Outcomes

Completing this assignment helped me:
Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.
Develop logical thinking for problem-solving.
Improve handling of user input and edge cases in interactive programs.
Write structured and readable code using functions and loops.
Build confidence in designing practical, console-based applications.
